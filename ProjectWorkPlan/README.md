### Detailed Project Work Plan

Note that tasks are in-order for completion.  While many tasks can be completed in parallel, those tasks which depend on one another are listed in order for each assignment.  At a minimum, the group assumes 1 day of work, at minimum, will occur between class dates.  This estimation will be used to communicate expectations for the task completion, ordered by row, for each assignment.
