|1| Chad| Why are the success outcomes higher when persons receive more time with staff whose pay is higher than the average across each service? What are the implications for HFS' usage of higher-paid staff positions for producing a higher success outcome for more at-risk patients? What is the potential increase in expected return if HFS increases the face-time of higher-paid staff with more at-risk patients?  We define success outcomes as those with lower than average duration times who also show for their appointments. |

## Research Question Descriptions
### Chad

The research question is interesting because it explores the relationship between staff pay, success outcome by service, and at-risk patients. The research question provides an opportunity to understand whether time with staff whose salary is above the service's median increases person outcomes and decreases service duration. The second research question builds on the first and asks whether this "increased success rate" effect exists for the population most likely to miss appointments and have longer durations. The third research question seeks to apply the discovered effect to the current state of HFS and determine whether its application would benefit the organization.

The research questions are useful for decision-makers in two ways; it explores a phenomenon: the effect of higher-paid staff on successful outcomes and applies the effect to benefit the organization's bottom dollar and the customer's success. As already shown, each of the three research questions builds upon one another. Moreover, the success or failure of any research question still provides insight concerning the HFS data.

### Sai Krishna 

#### **Find the relation between the events that took place in different location with respective to Gender.**

#### **why they Research Question?**

My Research Question can help the organization to identify the group of people who are taking part in the events which are organization .I like to create this because of it helps in identifying a set of people who are visiting the event based on their program with respect to genderand the location of the event took place. This will help to Heartland Family Service to get an idea about the types of genders who attended the meeting. There are 3 programs which were organized by Heartland Family Service. 1)Mental Health  2) Substance Use 3)Gambling. 

By subgrouping them according to the programs we can create a table which give us information about what type of gender is joining the event but if we identify the data in visualization, we can get what kind of gender is attending to an event. So, with that idea we can increase a greater number of events in different location.If increase the event with different in location, we can attract a greater number of people towards the HFS.

By doing this kind of research question we can increase the number of events in location where the number of  participations in even is less according to the gender and location.HFS can also increase their level of programs and service.


### Rhonda

### **How does the percentage of Hispanic/Latin men and women compare to the percentage of all other men and women seeking services?**

This research question will help explore the relationship of clients identifying as Hispanic and the type of services received and the location the service was received. We also need to know their primary language and if they would like counseling/literature in that language.

By asking this question we can find out if their should be bilingual employees at each location or one location with many bilingual employess.
